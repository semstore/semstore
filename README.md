<h1>Welcome to the SEM Store</h1>
<h2>Open source ecommerce</h2>

<h3>So what is it?</h3>
<p>SEM Solutions is a world leader in <a href="http://www.semsolutions.co.uk">data migrations</a> which may seem an odd place to start when developing an ecommerce solution, however in our daily lives as data mechanics we have a unique insight into the web &amp; the various applications that are out there.</p> 
<p>We see a lot of bad coding practice, ineffcient use of servers and just downright bad solutions. We also know that you should never highlight a problem unless you have a solution.</p>
<p><b>So the SEM Store was born</b></p>
<p>It has been developed in house to a high standard and implemented across many functional and busy stores, we thought it was time to let you all have a play.</p>
<h3>Our goals</h3>
<p>The project was started with very clear goals and milestones:
<ul>
    <li>Open source</li>
    <li>Easy to use</li>
    <li>Efficient use of memory</li>
    <li>Clean smooth interface</li>
    <li>The ability to have an extremely flexible backend, "I want to be able to list an apple next to a space rocket"</li>
    <li>Good coding practice</li>
    <li>Stability and speed under load and at size</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>All of these seem obvious but we feel that most of the widely used CMS systems have become far too bloated and complicated, often offering services clients do not use and get in the way. We have also found migrating these types of CMS to be tricky due to buggy code.</li>
<p>Often off the peg CMS systems are great for small shops but as soon as your business grows so does the time it takes for users to navigate through your site</li>

<h3>The Code</h3>
<p>As lead developer on this project I could bore you with the reasons why this code is just plain cool but I will leave that up to you to discover. Oh, you can stalk me at <a href="http://twitter.com/nomadcoder88">@nomadcoder88</a>.</p>
<h3>The Backing</h3>
<p>This open source software project has for the past 7 years been sponsored by <a href="http://www.semsolutions.co.uk">www.semsolutions.co.uk</a> under the leadership of Simon Mohr who can be found at <a href="http://twitter.com/canterbury">@canterburygeeks</a>. Simon &amp; SEM Solutions are committed to working closely with the community that we hope to build here while developing the SEM Store into a world class ecommerce platform.</p>
<h3>Going Forward</h3>
<p>We have great expectation for this CMS we know that due to the effcient way that it uses server-side resources it is sstable on the cloud where most CMS systems would suffocate. We are looking to work with developers who are keen to maintain the high coding standards and make some cool additions to our codebase</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>I also feel that I should mention that this isn't a untested product. Quite the contrary... we run many stores with the SEM Store ecommerce platform, some with many thousands of products and collectively with &pound;millions in sales. The SEM Store is rock solid and it has been for years.</p>
