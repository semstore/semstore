<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
<p>We have designed this site using <strong>PHP, mySQL and CSS</strong> for the formatting and layout. We have avoided using tables throughout the site although we have used a table on the client page for displaying the thumbnails.</p>
<p> Otherwise this site is table free, easy to amend and all the content is held separately from the formatting. <strong>At SEM Solutions we believe that Cascading Style Sheets should be used wherever possible although it is fair to say that until the issue of standards across all browsers is resolved the full potential of CSS will not be achieved. </strong>We also support the use of open source software and technologies where appropriate and we have utilsed the brilliant open source language PHP and mySQL database throughout.</p>
